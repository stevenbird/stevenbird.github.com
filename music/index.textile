p. Brazilian guitar music, a daily diversion...

- Emotiva #1 - H&eacute;lio Delmiro := _A reflective piece, which in its falling cadences and alternating harmonies and discords captures the sweet pain of nostalgia, or saudade_.

- Garota de Ipanema (Tom Jobim) - Baden Powell := _From a "transcription":http://www.brazil-on-guitar.de/pdf/pdf_powell_garota_de_ipanema.zip of a  1964 recording.  It features the characteristic collision of stopped and open strings, and the extended groups of three 16th notes.  Some percussion anchors it all._

- Um Abra&ccedil;o no Bonf&aacute; - Jo&atilde;o Gilberto := _One of my favourites, for its simple elegance.  The repeated 16th notes with their 4th-beat emphasis are reminiscent of the pandeiro.  Some low bass notes of the 7-string guitar appear in the middle section._
<div id="abraco">(sound player requires javascript to be enabled)</div>

- Estrella da Manh&atilde; - Marco Pereira := _Unique among Pereira's compositions for its "new age" feel.  I played this at a friend's memorial:  the morning star (represented in the harmonics) symbolised hope at the end of a long dark night - a new day._
<div id="estrella">(sound player requires javascript to be enabled)</div> 

- Sons de Carrilh&otilde;es - Jo&atilde;o Pernambuco := _So very sweet, just like a Brazilian dessert!_
<div id="carrilhoes">(sound player requires javascript to be enabled)</div>

- Tempo de Futebol - Marco Pereira := _This a kind of samba known as partido alto.  Its name comes from the light-footedness of a skilled soccer player; it is a study in lightness.  Note that the "improvisations" are written out in the published score.  A work in progress..._
