h1. {{ page.title }}

The village of Terra Preta is a short boat ride up the Rio Negro from Manaus. I went there last Sunday, wondering if I could interest the villagers in language recording work using our mobile phone app.

After leaving Manaus, we tracked along the northern bank of the river, about 50m out, dense rainforest on our right and a vast expanse of water on our left. The Rio Negro is more than 10km wide in places. We watched a little "tucuxi":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucuxi, or river dolphin, arching out of the water. Aldevan scared me with his talk about the hazards of the river, the "anaconda":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda, "jacaré":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacare_caiman, "piranha":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranha, "candirú":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candiru (notorious for invading the urethra). Our boat felt tiny as we were tossed around on the wake of the large boats coming in the opposite direction. Still, it was too hot to wear the life vest and it would only slow down my sprint to the shore if we were to capsize.

After filling up, we were on our way

After an hour and a half, our driver cut the engine and pulled through a narrow break in the semi-submerged trees that obscured the riverbank. Without the engine noise, the air was full of bird calls. Aldevan and I clambered out of the boat, glad to stretch our backs after the bumpy crouching boatride. Also with us was Isaac. He had joined me on a "trip to the Tembé village":http://theconversation.com/androids-in-amazonia-recording-an-endangered-language-12865, and who was keen for new adventure.

<br/>
The town of Terra Preta is centred on a soccer pitch, which seems to be a common plan for Indian villages (view a "satellite picture of the village":https://maps.google.com/?ll=-2.919854,-60.46787&z=17 via Google maps; zoom out for some context).

We were met by Arnaldo Yarumare. Opening my notebook, I mechanically asked Arnaldo for the name of his language. Baré, he replied. Then he added that no-one speaks Baré any more. How curious to be affiliated with a dead language. Later I checked the "Ethnologue entry for Baré":http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bae and found that the language is still spoken, though probably not for very much longer. Arnaldo continued: like some other Baré speakers, he has now switched to "Nhengatu":http://www.ethnologue.com/language/yrl, a language having 10,000 speakers. My curiosity about the language situation satisfied, I was glad to rest in a hammock in Arnaldo's breezy porch. It had been a 5am start that day. After an hour or so, Arnaldo asked if I would like to try some local food. I agreed and so he led us up the hill, threading our way through wooden houses mostly on stilts, greeting people along the way. _Yane kwema_.

We arrived at a building with a corrugated iron roof and no walls, set on a raised concrete base. Shade. The benches arranged around the perimeter were close to capacity with about 50 people. In the centre, a large table was set out with food. The moment we arrived everyone moved to the table, filled their plates, returned to the benches, and ate. Would we be invited to join them? No-one acknowledged our presence so I felt invisible, yet being unobserved I felt unselfconscious about observing. Monitoring whether people were speaking Portuguese or Nhengatu.

h2. Practical demonstration

After lunch the children disappeared, and Arnaldo publicly welcomed us. Aldevan talked about our language recording work. Soon it was my turn. I asked whether the children speak Nhengatu (they don't) and whether there are any storytellers (there are). They named one man who is now well into his eighties, but not present with us. I asked for a volunteer to tell a story to the group. After a brief pause there seemed to be consensus and a man called Jonas Alesio stood up. I handed him one of the phones and he recounted the story of the "Curupira":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curupira. His story enthralled his audience. Next, Samuel Alexo agreed to translate. After a 20-second demonstration, he used our "Aikuma":http://lp20.org/ app to translate Jonas' story into Portuguese.

Once he finished, I replayed the recording and translation to the group:

<div id="nhengatu_trans">(sound player requires javascript to be enabled)</div>

I asked whether they would like us to return another day to record more stories and prepare a CD. Samuel stood and addressed the group, explaining the importance of this work to record the language and to make sure that the children would be able to understand the stories. Now Samuel addressed me and spoke about the need for an exchange. They could participate in our recording work. Would we help them to produce a DVD?

I was struck by the fact that Samuel viewed their participation in audio recording as a favour to me, when I had just presented it as a favour to them. Perhaps Aldevan's introduction of me as a researcher was the trigger: Indians bristle at the word _pesquisador_, given the history of outsiders coming and taking things away. I offered to record some video but said I wasn't sure about producing DVDs. Perhaps they could do that in their computer room? Samuel offered to speak to the rest of the village and then contact us.

I was also surprised to discover that there was a computer room here. I asked to see it, and soon we were ushered into a room containing computers, monitors, a router, and uniterruptable power supplies. All still boxed. All to be powered by the generator for a few hours each day.

As we walked away, I commented to Isaac that this was our first experience of an immediately positive reception to this work. A village leader understood and valued the work, and publicly expressed a desire to cooperate. We were soon back at Arnaldo's house, with a meal of catfish and rice set out before us.

By now it was about 2pm. I settled down to wait for a couple of hours until we could go back on the river. Aldevan had said we should not be on the river between 9am and 4pm, as it was too rough. Then Aldevan and our driver speculated about staying in the village overnight. I wasn't sure that I heard right. Isaac wondered if they wanted to go fishing. I pictured another lengthy village exit, and decided to press Aldevan to return at 4pm, or even earlier if possible. Five minutes later we were on the boat pulling out into the big river on calm water.

h2. A new realisation

On the boat ride back to Manaus I reflected on our brief recording session. There was the woman videoing Jonas on her phone, who kept getting in the way of my photography. Why didn't I get a wide-angle shot including her? There was Jonas' one-handed gestures, while he held the phone in his other hand. There was the request to assist with a DVD. The whole situation was screaming VIDEO at me.

There was also the slow process of capturing the speaker's details in the phone before recording; could this be made any easier?

Collecting `metadata': entering the speaker's name, language, etc

There was the computer room, and the fact that many villages are getting grants to set them up. There was the wireless router which they unboxed in front of me. There was the requirement to store recordings locally. A local area network and associated file storage would soon be in place.

In this place, and others like it, video documentation on mobile phones would be possible. This was a game changer. There would be network capacity for synchronizing video recordings to a computer and to other phones. The person being recorded would not have to hold the phone -- someone else would be videoing. We would need a new app, one which supported video playback. A user would pause the video to record an audio commentary or translation. Another playback mode would interleave the video with the spoken translation. People would share videos and playlists. The locally-owned phones would become the dissemination medium. Or something like that.

I need to think about it some more.
