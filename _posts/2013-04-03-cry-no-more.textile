Sometimes, life is like moving slowly, under unbroken ice, heart barely beating, searching for the airhole...

Earlier this year, the woman who had stolen my heart casually tossed it away. A month later, frozen, anoxic, trapped, but somehow still beating.

Now I was far from home in the wet heat of the Amazon rainforest. Every sensation contradicted my inner frozen world.

I picked up my beautiful new hand-made Brazilian guitar. I opened my music book, and returned to this sublime piece, 



I play on my own now. The baseline a heart beating slowly under the frozen surface of the top line, no gap to breathe.

Blah blah...

Blah blah...
Blah blah...

| You won't make it better, no way, you don't have control over it... |
| Cry cry, cry cry, no more, cry cry, cry cry, regret.                |
| Cry cry, cry cry, no more, try try, try now, forget.                |

| Take a look around the world, there's so much more to see.    |
| You can honour what has gone, and be free!                    |
| Yes its your right to be alive, loving breathing in each day, |
| There's a chance each road you take.                          |
